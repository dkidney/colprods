Description: A lightweight package containing various functions
    for calculating the column products of numeric matrices. Each
    function performs essentially the same task but each uses a different
    implementation under the hood. The main purpose of this package is to
    provide a simple example to remind myself how to incorporate Rcpp and
    RcppArmadillo functions within a package.
