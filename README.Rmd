# colprods

The goal of colprods is to provide a simple example of how to incorporate Rcpp and RcppArmadillo functions into a package. It does this using various implementations of a function to calculate the column products of a numeric matrix.

## Installation

You can install the released version of colprods from [Github](https://www.github.com/dkidney/colprods) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("dkidney/colprods")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(colprods)
x = matrix(1:9, 3)
colprods_for_loop(x)
colprods_sapply(x)
colprods_apply(x)
colprods_rcpp(x)
colprods_rcpp_rowwise(x)
colprods_arma(x)
as.numeric(colprods_arma(x))
```
